# GDP_EcologicalFootprint_Project
Project using statistical re-sampling techniques to analyse trends in ecological footprint and GDP of different countries

The ability of a country to utilize its natural resources for economic prosperity has always been a vital component of any nation. However, an overall disregard for the sustainability of those resources has resulted in the Earth being at a net deficit in terms of the amount of resources ecosystems are able to to regenerate with respect to comsumption. This analysis aims to further understand the relationship between the economic strength of a country (measured by its GDP) and its environmental impact (measured by its ecological footprint). Furthermore, to measure differences in this relationship between countries running at an ecologcial deficit with respect to their domestic biocapacity and countries operating in ecological reserve. Using the statistical resampling techniques of permutation tests, a Jackknife estimator and non parametric bootstrapping with 2014 data from the Global Footprint Network, a strong correlation between GDP and ecologcial footprint was observed. However no difference in this correlation or average GDP was found between countries in ecological deficit versus those not. These results suggest that if the goal of reducing our global ecological footprint is to be achieved through national initiatives these solutions must be economically practical but are indeed possible as already demonstrated by several countries.
